A simple checkers game that uses javafx.

This program offers a functioning player vs player game mode. Players drag and drop their pieces on their turn. Currently, the program declares a winner if one player cpatures all of the other player's pieces.

This program is still being developed. In the future this program will offer...
-a player vs computer (simple ai) game mode
-declaration of a winner if either player has no more moves left
