# GUICheckers
A simple checkers game that uses javafx.

This program offers a functioning player vs player game mode. Players drag and drop their pieces on their turn. Currently, the program declares a winner if one player cpatures all of the other player's pieces.

This program is still being developed. In the future this program will offer...
1) a player vs computer (simple ai) game mode
2) declaration of a winner if either player has no more moves left

This program can be paired with my ConsoleCheckers program to allow the user to pick their preferred ui (see the main method).
